#Two Part Project:

1. System Enhancements

   - Requirements

   - Design

   - Implementation

2. Testing

   - Black Box

   - White Box  

This web-based or mobile-based application should be easy to use, yet powerful software; it should be an interactive application between user and software system. 


#Black box testing
See test cases template

#White box testing 
Involves: testing software code for:
Internal security holes
Broken or poorly structured paths in the coding processes
The flow of specific inputs through the code
Expected output
The functionality of conditional loops
Testing of each statement, object, and function on an individual basis
Testing can be done at: 

system
integration
unit levels 
One basic goal of white-box testing includes: verify a working flow for an application. 

In other words, it involves testing a series of predefined inputs against expected or desired outputs so that when a specific input does not result in the expected output, you have encountered a bug.
